[28th November] - Sprint 3 Standup 1 Notes by Helena

1. What did you work on since the last stand up?
   We had gone through the sprint 2 handout individually prior to our meeting and figured out what we are supposed to deliver at the end of the sprint.
   each person had taken couple of features in mind so we could discuss about them in the meeting and choose the best out of them.

team capacity: 5
participants: Zuhaib, Karim, Helena, Nargis, Ajwad

2. What do you commit to next?
   We agreed on the features that we are going to implement and we splitted them between all the team members.
   Nargis is going to continue on the category feature as was not done in previouse sprint due to her sickness
   I,Karim,Ajwad are going to work on documentations and trello trachings
   Zuhaib is going to work on search filter feature
  

3. When do you think you'll be done?
   Implementation of the features should be done by Saturday so we have enough time to demo and record it as well and also,
   the parts such Sprint3.md, and updates for system design document should be done by end of the day of 30th so for our next stand up we have those done and we can start our implementation for the features and rest of the steps of the handout.
   we are going to start working on each task as of Today as we all have different assignments and projects too
   tasks has been distributed among all team members so each individual can contribute and get the work done earlier.

4. Do you have any blockers?
   So far no blockers in the first standup and everyone should be able to get things done by our next stand up with no issue.
