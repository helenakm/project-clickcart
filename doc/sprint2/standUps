[13th November] - Sprint 1 Standup 1 Notes by Helena

1. What did you work on since the last stand up?
We had gone through the sprint 2 handout individually prior to our meeting and figured out what we are supposed to deliver at the end of the sprint.
each person had taken couple of features in mind so we could discuss about them in the meeting and choose the best out of them.

team capacity: 5
participants: Zuhaib, Karim, Helena, Nargis, Ajwad

2. What do you commit to next?
We agreed on the features that we are going to implement and we splitted them between all the team members.
Nargis and Zuhaib are going to both work on ...
I am going to work on adding the review section 
Karim for now is going to complete the issues with add to cart feature 
Ajwad is going to work on SR2


3. When do you think you'll be done?
Implementation of the features should be done by Saturday so we have enough time to demo and record it as well and also,
the parts such Sprint2.md, and updates for system design document should be done by end of the day of 15th so for our next stand up we have those done and we can start our implementation for the features and rest of the steps of the handout.
So far our main focus until our next stand up would be completing the Sprint2,Standups and system design document steps as well as satrting to implement our assigned features.
tasks has been distributed among all team members so each individual can contribute and get the work done earlier.

4. Do you have any blockers?
So far no blockers in the first standup and everyone should be able to get things done by our next stand up with no issue.
